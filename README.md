# FLIN Apps
This project addresses a comprehensive web development assignment for FLIN, focusing on key areas such as chatbot implementation, webpage optimization, API development and deployment, and secure authentication setup. The chatbot answers common user queries and is embedded as a floating widget. Web optimization improves performance through techniques like lazy loading and asset minification. A RESTful API for lead management is built and integrated into a frontend form. Additionally, a secure authentication system with JWT is implemented using a database backend. Each part includes detailed documentation, code, and performance metrics to ensure clarity and reproducibility.
